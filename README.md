# SolEx Lighttight Case

Unofficial modification of the SolEx case to include an interlocking flange and groove in the top and bottom case respectively, to help keep the internal cavity of the case lighttight. The current case design requires lapping the two mating surfaces by sanding then or sealing the interface with tape which this modification does not require.
